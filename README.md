## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js 
- Database: ( MongoDB)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Payment Gateway: Stripe
- Stripe is a powerful and flexible payment processing platform designed to handle online payments. Integrating Stripe into the hotel management web application allows for secure and efficient processing of payments for reservations and other hotel services. This integration involves both frontend and backend components to ensure a seamless payment experience.

Frontend Integration
Load Stripe.js: Stripe.js is a JavaScript library that securely collects payment details from your users.
Create a Payment Component: Develop a dedicated payment component that integrates with Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt UI components that helps you securely collect card details.
Handle Payment Submission: Implement functionality to handle the submission of payment details to Stripe, manage any validation errors, and provide feedback to the user.
Backend Integration
Install Stripe Library: Use Stripe’s official server-side libraries to interact with the Stripe API from your backend.
Create Payment Intents: Implement an endpoint to create payment intents. A payment intent represents the process of collecting payment from a customer.
Handle Webhooks: Set up webhooks to handle asynchronous events from Stripe, such as payment confirmation, to update the application state accordingly.
Security
Tokenization: Stripe.js ensures that sensitive card details are never passed through or stored on your server. Instead, they are sent directly to Stripe’s servers in exchange for a token.
SSL/TLS: Ensure that all interactions with your web application are conducted over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
User Experience
Real-Time Feedback: Provide users with immediate feedback on the payment status, including success, failure, or pending.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle any errors that occur during the payment process, providing users with clear instructions on how to resolve them.
